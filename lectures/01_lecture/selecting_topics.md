## The Presentation

During the last session, you are supposed to present your problem, introduce the solution, and showcase some results.
Each presentation is supposed to fit into **six minutes**, so there is enough time for additional questions.

We expect the following structure:

- Describe the problem you were solving in simple terms, so it is easy to follow. An essential part of the introduction
  is also motivation for the problem.
- Briefly discuss the dataset you used.
- Introduce your solution to the problem. Give a high-level description of your solution.
- Evaluate achieved results and compare them with your expectations (or a baseline, if there is one).
- Describe the following steps, if there are any.

We leave the format of your presentation up to you. However, we prefer a presentation following this
